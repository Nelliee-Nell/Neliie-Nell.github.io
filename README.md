# Neliie-Nell.github.io

1. Chanell Clifton; cdclifton@my.waketech.edu
2. This is my 2nd Github account, as I couldn’t remember the login from my first ne. This Github account is very new and named after my go-to social media username, Nelliee Nell.
3. The repository created I just realized is spelled incorrectly. It’s supposed to be Nelliee-Nell. Not sure how to change that but we will deal with that later.
4. To clone the repository, I simply logged into my Github Desktop app, and selected clone repository. I then decided to keep the defaulted folder where the repository is currently stored and clicked ‘clone’.
