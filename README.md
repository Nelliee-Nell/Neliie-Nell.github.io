1. Chanell Clifton; cdclifton@my.waketech.edu
2. This is my 2nd Github account, as I couldn’t remember the login from my first ne. This Github account is very new and named after my go-to social media username, Nelliee Nell.
3. The repository created I just realized is spelled incorrectly. It’s supposed to be Nelliee-Nell. Not sure how to change that but we will deal with that later.
4. To clone the repository, I simply logged into my Github Desktop app, and selected clone repository. I then decided to keep the defaulted folder where the repository is currently stored and clicked ‘clone’

   ### Some websites that I find interesting are _LinkedIn_ and _Amazon_.
   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/)- LinkedIn is interesting because it's social media platform designed for professionals. It allows users to create profiles to showcase their work experience, skills, and education. I use it a lot to find like-minded individuals with similar professions as myself.
   >
   [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)- Amazon is where I do a lot of my online shopping as it's an online shopping website where you can buy a wide variety of products, including books, electronics, clothing, and more!
